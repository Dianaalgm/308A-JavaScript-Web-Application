In this webpage I used the same CatApi we used in class to make the process simple for me. I have two buttons, when you click on the 'cute' button the score on top will 
increase everytime you click on it, it will also change the image. When you click on the 'not so cute' button it will change the image to the next image. As I was creating 
the modules I wasnt sure what I wanted in each one so it may seem all over the place but I was able to export and import all async functions.
